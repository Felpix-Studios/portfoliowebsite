You read the title, and now you’re reading this. Frankly, why? Just, why? Out of all the things you could be doing, you’ve found this strange, isolated website from the depths of the web. Anyways, thanks for stopping by, it means a lot to me. Now that that’s out of the way, what the hell is in store for this blog and what do I plan to write?  
Honestly, I’ve no idea. However, all the posts will probably fall into the following broad sections:  

 - Slice of life, like that seasonal anime
 - Software development, *Essays on Failure*
 - Design, well, at least it looks nice
 - Book/Media reviews
 - Stonks, r/wallstreetbets but with worse gains and better losses
 - And lastly, blurbs of random, meaningless text

Stick around if you want to read ‘em. Maybe a couple will be interesting, maybe not. If a blog is supposed to spread information, consider me investigated by multiple agencies for fraud. This blog is hereby active, or something like that. Again, I don’t know what I’m doing.
